Partial source code for https://lowwah.itch.io/war-with-infinity-fantasy-heronine-edition

It does not include any images or the encryption key and iv. 
Some of the images are paid so I just dont want to share them.

because of the above, you will not be able to run the project, this is more to view the code to see how i have emplemented somethings, e.g encryption, turn based battle etc. Though the code is not very clean so hopefully you can still get something out of it

If you want to study more on turn based battle systems, I recommend looking up RPG Maker MV's battle system. That is the game engine I use and what this battle system is based on
